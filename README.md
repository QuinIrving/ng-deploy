# A Coffee Infused Portfolio

### _A custom Angular-based personal site with a warm, breakfast aesthetic._

## The Concept

This project was designed to be a "digital cafe" a cozy, non-intimidating space to showcase my work. The goal was to move away from the "sterile/tech" look and create something with organic textures, warm tones, and handcrafted CSS components.

## Tech Stack

-   **Framework:** Angular (TypeScript)
    
-   **Styling:** Custom CSS (No UI libraries like Bootstrap/Material)
    
-   **Markup:** Component-based HTML generation

## Key Technical Highlights

### Handcrafted Aesthetic

The "Coffee/Breakfast" theme was achieved through custom CSS layering:

-   **Custom UI Elements:** Specialized buttons and cards designed to look like eggs, or waffle makers.
    
-   **Warm Palette:** A curated variable-based color system using cream, espresso, and soft amber tones.
    
-   **Responsive Layout:** Flexbox and Percentage based implementations to ensure the "cafe" stays organized on mobile.
    

### Angular Generation

I utilized Angular's core features to keep the code DRY:

-   **Structural Directives:** Used `*ngFor` to dynamically generate project tiles and list of skills from data.
    
-   **Component Architecture:** Separated the Navigation, Projects, and About Me into modular, reusable components.
    

## Status & Limitations

**Note on the "Projects" Section:** This repository serves as a **Frontend & Design Archive**. The "Projects" cards are visual representations of the UI layout and utilize Angular's data-binding to display information. They are currently static and do not link to external sites, as the focus of this specific iteration was on **visual consistency and component architecture** rather than external routing.
